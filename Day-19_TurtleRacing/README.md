# 🐢 Turtle Racing Game

A fun Python project using the **Turtle Graphics module** that simulates a colorful turtle race!  
You can place a bet on which turtle (by color) will win, then watch the race unfold randomly.

---

## 🎯 Features

- Interactive race with 6 colorful turtles  
- User input for choosing a turtle to bet on  
- Randomized movement to simulate real racing dynamics  
- Displays whether you win or lose based on your chosen color  
- Simple graphical interface using Python’s `turtle` library  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Learned

- Working with **Turtle graphics** for animation  
- Using **loops** and **conditional logic** to control flow  
- Handling **user input** via `screen.textinput()`  
- Generating randomness with `random.randint()`  
- Manipulating **object properties and methods**

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The game creates a race track with 6 turtles of different colors.  
2. You’re prompted to enter a color to bet on (e.g., “blue”).  
3. Each turtle moves forward a random distance between 0 and 10 pixels per frame.  
4. The first turtle to cross the finish line (x > 230) wins!  
5. The program announces if your turtle color won or lost.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed (version 3.x).  
2. Save the script as `main.py`.  
3. Run it using the command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. A window will open where you can input your bet and watch the race!

You've won! The green turtle is the winner! 🎉

or

You've lost! The blue turtle is the winner! 🏁

## 🎓 Credits

This project was inspired by the Hirst Painting Project from the
100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.
I learned and implemented it independently for practice and creativity.
