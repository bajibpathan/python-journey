# 🐍 Snake Game in Python

A classic **Snake Game** built using Python’s `turtle` graphics module.  
The objective is simple — eat food to grow longer and survive as long as possible without hitting the walls or yourself!

## 🎮 Features

- Smooth snake movement with arrow key controls
- Randomly appearing food that increases score and snake length
- Collision detection with walls and tail
- Real-time scoreboard that updates dynamically
- "Game Over" screen when the player loses

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run the main script in your terminal or IDE:
