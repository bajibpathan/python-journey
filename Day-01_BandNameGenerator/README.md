# 🎶 Day 01: Band Name Generator  

This is the first project of my **100 Days of Python Journey**.  
It’s a simple and fun program that generates a random **band name** based on the user’s input.  

---

## 📖 What I Learned  
- How to use **variables** to store user input.  
- How to use `print()` to display messages.  
- How to take user input with `input()`.  
- How to concatenate strings in Python.  
- Structuring a beginner-friendly project.   

---

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. The program welcomes the user.  
2. It asks for:  
   - The name of the city they grew up in.  
   - The name of their pet.  
3. It combines both answers and suggests a band name.  

**Example Run:**  
```python
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
What's the name of the city you grew up in?

Toronto
What's your pet's name?
Luna
Your band name could be Toronto Luna
```
