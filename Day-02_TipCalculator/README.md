# 💵 Day 02: Tip Calculator  

This is the second project of my **100 Days of Python Journey**.  
It’s a simple calculator that helps split a restaurant bill evenly among friends, including a tip percentage.

## 📖 What I Learned  
- Using **variables** to store and reuse values.  
- Working with different **data types**: `int`, `float`.  
- Taking user input with `input()` and converting it into numbers using `int()` / `float()`.  
- Performing **arithmetic operations** to calculate percentages.  
- Using the `round()` function to format results.  
- Displaying results with **f-strings** for clean output.

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. The program welcomes the user.  
2. It asks for:  
   - The total bill amount.  
   - The percentage tip (10%, 12%, or 15%).  
   - The number of people splitting the bill.  
3. It calculates:  
   - The total tip amount.  
   - The total bill including tip.  
   - The split amount per person, rounded to 2 decimals.  

**Example Run:**  
```python
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $150
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 5
Each person should pay: $33.6
```
