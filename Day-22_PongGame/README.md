# 🏓 Pong Game (Python Turtle)

A classic **Pong Game** built using Python’s `turtle` graphics module.  
Two players control paddles to bounce the ball back and forth — the first to miss loses a point!

---

## 🎯 Game Objective
Keep the ball from passing your paddle!  
Each time your opponent misses, you score a point.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Two-player gameplay (Right player uses arrow keys, Left player uses W/S)
- Realistic paddle and ball collision mechanics
- Dynamic ball speed increases with each hit
- Automatic score tracking and display
- Game resets the ball after each point

---

## 🕹️ Controls

| Player | Move Up | Move Down |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| 🟦 Left Paddle | **W** | **S** |
| 🟥 Right Paddle | **Up Arrow** | **Down Arrow** |

This project helped me understand:
- Object-Oriented Programming in Python
- Inheritance and class interaction between multiple modules
- Event listeners and keyboard input using `turtle`
- Game loop management and collision detection
- Screen updates and timing control
