# Treasure Island 🏝️

A fun, interactive **text-based adventure game** built with Python.  
Your mission is simple: **find the treasure without getting caught by traps, beasts, or bad choices!**

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

The game starts with an ASCII treasure map banner and welcomes you to Treasure Island.  
You will be presented with multiple choices (`left/right`, `wait/swim`, door colors), and each choice leads you closer to the treasure — or straight to **Game Over**!

**Example flow:**
1. Choose your path at the crossroad (`left` or `right`).
2. Decide whether to wait for a boat or swim across the lake.
3. Pick the correct door color to find the treasure.

Each wrong move ends the game, but the right combination leads to victory.
