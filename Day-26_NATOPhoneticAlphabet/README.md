# 🔤 NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter

A simple yet powerful Python program that converts any input word into the **NATO Phonetic Alphabet**.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Python dictionary comprehension** for fast lookups.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The NATO phonetic alphabet is used in aviation, military, and telecommunications to ensure clear communication of letters over radio or phone.  
This project helps you learn:

- How to read CSV data using `pandas`
- How to create dictionaries from data frames
- How to use list comprehensions effectively

## 🧩 Example

**Input:**
Enter a word: Hello

**Output:**
['Hotel', 'Echo', 'Lima', 'Lima', 'Oscar']

## 🧠 Data Source

The CSV file (nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv) contains the standard NATO alphabet mapping:

| Letter | Code    |
| ------ | ------- |
| A      | Alfa    |
| B      | Bravo   |
| C      | Charlie |
| D      | Delta   |
