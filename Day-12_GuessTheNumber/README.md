# 🎯 Number Guessing Game — Python Project

A simple and fun **Number Guessing Game** built with Python!  
The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and your job is to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Two difficulty levels: **Easy (10 attempts)** and **Hard (5 attempts)**.
- Feedback for every guess — “Too high” or “Too low”.
- Automatically ends when you guess correctly or run out of turns.
- Clean and modular code with functions and docstrings.

---

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Run the program in your terminal.
2. The computer will think of a random number between **1 and 100**.
3. Choose a difficulty level:
   - Type **easy** for 10 guesses.
   - Type **hard** for 5 guesses.
4. Start guessing! You’ll get hints after each attempt.
5. The game ends when you either guess correctly or run out of turns.

## 🧩 Example Run

```
🎯 Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100
Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': easy

You have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 50
Too high.
Guess again!

You have 9 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 25
Too low.
Guess again!

You have 8 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 37
🎉 You got it! The correct answer was 37.
```

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to use **functions and docstrings** for clean and reusable code.
- Using **constants** for configuration (like difficulty levels).
- Working with **loops, conditions**, and **return values**.
- Generating **random numbers** using the `random` module.
- Designing **user-friendly CLI interactions**.
