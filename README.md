# 🐍 100 Days of Python Journey

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python Journey**! 🎯

In this repository, I’ll be learning Python step by step and building projects daily — starting from beginner basics and moving towards advanced real-world applications.

The goal is to **learn by doing**: each day includes learning a new Python concept and creating a project to apply it.

> ⚡ Credits: This journey is inspired by and follows [Dr. Angela Yu’s Udemy Course – _100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023_](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).  
> Many of the projects and exercises here are based on her structured curriculum.
